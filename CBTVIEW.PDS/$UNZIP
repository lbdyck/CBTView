The unzip utility that is used by CBTView during execution will be one
found in the active PATH, and if not found then a unzip utility will be
copied from the UNZIP member of the FILEIDX.PDS into /tmp with a
temporary change to the PATH for that invocation.

The unzip that is included is found in the UNZIPXMI member as a TSO
Transmit (XMIT) format with an imbedded PAX of the unzip executable.
This executable is from the zopen project. The license for it is found
in member UNZIPL.
